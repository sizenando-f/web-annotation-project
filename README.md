# web-annotation-project

Just make your own private annotations!
<br>
This project is completly made with pure javascript, that is, without any use of databases to storage your annotations or frameworks, is used only your browser local storage (and my few neurons), what makes hard to create all the logic behind every action the user make without errors, so be patient, I'm still learning!
